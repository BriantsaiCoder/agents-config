# Security audit setup

Owned by [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

## Setup

Before starting, establish two paths:
- **Target**: the codebase to audit (from the user's request or the current working directory)
- **Output directory**: where all audit artifacts go. Default to `~/security-audit-skill/<repo-name>/run-<N>` where `<N>` is the next unused integer (check what exists with `ls`); ask only when that path is not writable. Create it if it doesn't exist. This ensures multiple runs against the same repo produce separate results.

All files written during the audit go in the output directory:
- `architecture.md` — Phase 1 output, fed into Phase 2 agent prompts
- `REPORT.md` — human-readable report (Phase 4)
- `FINDINGS-DETAIL.md` — detailed data flows for MEDIUM+ findings (Phase 4)
- `findings.json` — machine-readable structured output (Phase 5)

Subagents (Phases 2, 3, 6) do NOT write files — they return results to you via the Task tool. You are responsible for writing all files to the output directory.

### Coverage and prior runs

Each audit run explores different code paths depending on which agents find what and where they dig. No single run finds everything. Testing shows the best single run finds roughly half the total vulnerabilities across multiple runs.

**If prior runs exist** for the same repo (check `~/security-audit-skill/<repo-name>/`), read their `findings.json` files before starting Phase 2. Use them to:
1. **Skip known findings** — don't waste agents re-discovering the same status bypass. Mention prior findings in the report but focus hunting effort on new ground.
2. **Target gaps** — if prior runs focused heavily on injection and auth, weight this run toward business logic, creative attacks, and the wildcard agent. If prior runs missed public endpoints, focus there.
3. **Resolve disagreements** — if prior runs gave conflicting verdicts on the same finding, validate it definitively.

Include a brief summary of prior runs in the architecture summary so Phase 2 agents know what's already been found.

**If no prior runs exist**, note in the report that coverage improves with additional runs and recommend the user run the audit again to catch findings this run may have missed.

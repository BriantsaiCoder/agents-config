# Vendored forks — accepted, recorded, re-mergeable

Vendored skills take no in-place structural edit (see `skills/auditing-skill-folder/step0-vendored-gate.md`). That rule is a **default requiring a recorded override**, not an absolute. This file is the record. A fork that is not listed here is an unrecorded fork — a defect, not a decision.

Listing a skill here does NOT reopen it for further editing. It records one decision already taken, with the procedure to reconcile it when upstream moves.

<!-- MACHINE-READ by skills/auditing-skill-folder/scripts/lib-vendored.sh (fork_recorded).
     An index row MUST begin with "| `" followed by the exact skill directory name.

| Skill | Upstream | Forked from | Local change | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `design-doc-mermaid` | github.com/SpillwaveSolutions/design-doc-mermaid (v2.0.0) | `SKILL.md` 21,268B — byte-identical to upstream `main` HEAD, last pushed 2025-12-29 | `6daf12c` — −153 lines, pure de-duplication | **Retired to `attic/` 2026-07-25** |
| `tailwind-v4-shadcn` | github.com/jezweb/claude-skills (v1.0.0, per `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; author Jeremy Dawes, MIT) | `9fdb7f2` baseline — a snapshot of an upstream layout that no longer exists; upstream renamed and restructured it to `plugins/frontend/skills/tailwind-theme-builder` | 2026-07-25 — two factual corrections in `references/common-gotchas.md` §17 and `rules/tailwind-v4-shadcn.md` | **Active** |

Retired entries stay listed: the `attic/` copy still differs from upstream, so anyone restoring it needs this record. `check-vendored.sh` does not scan `attic/`, so a retired entry no longer renders as `VND*`.

## Retired vendored — no local modification (NOT forks)

Deliberately outside the index table above: these were never edited, so they are not forks and must not render as recorded forks. The record exists because retirement itself is a decision that needs a restore path.

**`ecpay` — retired to `attic/` 2026-07-25.**

- Upstream `github.com/ECPay/ECPay-API-Skill.git`, detached at `5b1ac76` (2026-07-07), per `attic/ecpay/UPSTREAM.txt`.
- LICENSE is **All Rights Reserved**, Copyright (c) 2025-2026 綠界科技股份有限公司 — not open source. It may be kept locally but not redistributed.
- **Zero local modification**: `git log --follow -- skills/ecpay/SKILL.md` shows one commit (`9fdb7f2`, the baseline import). The `attic/` copy is byte-identical to what was vendored, so no re-merge procedure is needed — restoring means re-cloning upstream or `git mv attic/ecpay skills/ecpay`.
- Removed on user instruction while trimming the resident skill listing. Wholesale removal is legal under the vendored gate — what is forbidden is editing in place.
- Cost it was carrying: 319 chars of name+description in every session's skill listing (2.9MB / 295 files on disk, which cost nothing resident).
- **Restore when**: a project actually integrates ECPay 金流 / 電子發票 / 物流. The knowledge is 綠界-specific and not model-stable — 12-language CheckMacValue / AES vectors, ECPG vs ecpayment dual-domain traps, per-service test MerchantIDs. Nothing else in `skills/` covers it.

## tailwind-v4-shadcn

**Decision (2026-07-25): accept the fork. Two factual corrections, both confirmed against upstream's current version.**

### Detection caveat — read this before trusting `check-vendored.sh` on this skill

`check-vendored.sh` does **not** flag `tailwind-v4-shadcn`, and adding it to the index above will not make it render `VND*`. The detector reads a LICENSE file plus an upstream marker inside the frontmatter; this skill has neither. Its only provenance is `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, a marketplace manifest the detector never opens:

```json
{ "author": { "name": "Jeremy Dawes", "email": "jeremy@jezweb.net" },
  "license": "MIT", "repository": "https://github.com/jezweb/claude-skills" }
```

The same blind spot hides `agent-browser` (its `upstream:` marker sits in an HTML comment *after* the closing `---`, so the detector's awk exits before reaching it). Real vendored count is 7, detector finds 5 — see "## Detector gap — check-vendored.sh misses 2 of 7" below.

### What was wrong

Both defects were flagged in `proposals/2026-07-25-skill-audit/02-recommendations.md` (Batch B) and left unexecuted. Both are the skill contradicting itself, and following either branch produces broken output:

| Where | Said | Reality |
|---|---|---|
| `references/common-gotchas.md` §17 | `@import "tw-animate-css"` → "Package doesn't exist in v4"; install nothing, use native CSS animations | `rules/tailwind-v4-shadcn.md:45,51` in the *same skill* says `pnpm add -D tw-animate-css` and import it |
| `rules/tailwind-v4-shadcn.md:63-66,117` | "`@apply` — ❌ Deprecated in v4" | `SKILL.md:27` in the *same skill* says only "Avoid `@apply` for semantic token plumbing" |

### Why the fork was accepted rather than reported

Upstream's current version settles both, in our favour — verified 2026-07-25 against `plugins/frontend/skills/tailwind-theme-builder`:

- `SKILL.md:46` `pnpm add -D tw-animate-css`, `SKILL.md:77` `@import "tw-animate-css";` — the package exists and is the v4 path. §17 was simply wrong.
- `SKILL.md:197` lists only "Use `@apply` with `@layer base` classes (use `@utility` instead)" as the thing to avoid — `@apply` is not deprecated. Our correction adopts that `@utility` guidance verbatim.

So this is error correction validated by upstream, not local opinion injected into third-party content — the same category as `design-doc-mermaid`'s de-duplication.

**The merge-conflict cost that normally justifies the vendored rule does not exist here.** Upstream deleted both edited files: `tailwind-theme-builder` has no `common-gotchas.md` and no `rules/` directory at all. There is nothing upstream left for these edits to conflict with.

### Re-merge procedure (when upstream moves)

There is no 3-way merge to perform — the file-level correspondence is gone. If upstream is to be tracked again, it is a **replacement decision**, not a merge:

1. Diff our `SKILL.md` + `templates/` against `plugins/frontend/skills/tailwind-theme-builder/{SKILL.md,assets/}` — these are the only parts with a surviving upstream counterpart.
2. Decide whether the local-only material still earns its place: `references/common-gotchas.md` (17 gotchas) and `rules/tailwind-v4-shadcn.md` exist **only** in our snapshot. Upstream dropped them; nothing recovers them but this copy.
3. If replacing wholesale, that is legal under the gate — but the 17 gotchas and the rules file are lost with it. Copy forward anything still true first.
4. Update the "Forked from" cell above with the new upstream ref.

## design-doc-mermaid

**Decision 1 (2026-07-25): accept the fork. Do not re-pull.**
**Decision 2 (2026-07-25, same day): retire the skill entirely to `attic/`.** See "Retired" below — this supersedes the fork question in practice, but the record is kept because the `attic/` copy is still a fork of upstream.

### Why re-pulling was rejected

Our import baseline (`9fdb7f2`) is byte-identical to upstream's current `main` HEAD. Upstream has not changed `SKILL.md` since we took it, and its last push of any kind was 2025-12-29. So a re-pull recovers **zero** upstream improvement and its only effect would be to re-inflate 3.3KB of redundancy that `6daf12c` removed.

The recurring merge-conflict cost that justifies the vendored rule is unrealized here, and at this upstream cadence is not imminent. The rule was still right to flag it — the flag is what turned a silent fork into this record.

### What the fork actually is

Pure de-duplication, not customization. `6daf12c` removed three blocks from `SKILL.md` whose content already lived in the skill's own reference files, replacing each with a pointer:

| Removed from `SKILL.md` | Already present in |
|---|---|
| Resilient Workflow overview, file-naming convention, error-recovery priority chain | `references/guides/resilient-workflow.md` (16,172B, verified superset) |
| Three Unicode example diagrams | `unicode-symbols/guide.md` |
| Python utility flag examples | the three scripts' own `argparse --help` |

Preserved: the behavioural rule *"NEVER add a diagram to markdown until it passes validation."* No local opinion was injected; no behaviour changed. All internal pointers in the forked `SKILL.md` resolve (verified 2026-07-25).

### Re-merge procedure (when upstream moves)

1. Fetch upstream `SKILL.md` and diff it against our baseline `git show 9fdb7f2:skills/design-doc-mermaid/SKILL.md` — that is the true 3-way merge base, NOT our current file.
2. Apply the upstream delta to the baseline.
3. Re-apply the three condensations in the table above. The conflict region is confined to them; resolving is mechanical, not a judgement call.
4. Re-verify every `references/`, `scripts/`, `checklists/`, `unicode-symbols/` pointer in the result still resolves.
5. Update the "Forked from" cell in the index above with the new upstream ref.

### Retired (2026-07-25)

Moved to `attic/design-doc-mermaid` and removed from routing. Wholesale removal is legal under the gate — what is forbidden is editing in place.

Evidence it contributed nothing:

- **`mmdc` is not installed.** All three of its scripts hard-depend on `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`, so none of them could run. Its entire mechanical value — validation, image conversion, the resilient error-recovery chain — was never available on this machine.
- **The artifact it supposedly produced needs no tooling.** `docs/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` in the DCT project is 8 inline ````` ```mermaid ````` fenced blocks, 0 image references, no `diagrams/` directory. `專案架構視覺化.html` renders client-side via mermaid.js, not from pre-rendered images.
- **0 dispatches across 398 startups**, despite being hard-referenced in four routing files plus `dist/skill-index.md`.

What remains capable of producing the same output: writing ````` ```mermaid ````` fences directly. GitHub, Claude artifacts, and that HTML all render mermaid natively.

**The one scenario that would justify restoring it:** wanting pre-rendered PNG/SVG architecture diagrams committed to the repo, rather than fences rendered by the viewer. That needs `npm i -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` plus this skill back out of `attic/` — follow the re-merge procedure above if upstream has moved by then.

## Detector gap — check-vendored.sh misses 2 of 7

Recorded 2026-07-25. `scripts/check-vendored.sh` reports 5 vendored skills; the real count is 7. Both misses were found by hand during the description-trim pass, which is exactly the review the detector exists to make unnecessary.

| Skill | Provenance | Why the detector misses it |
|---|---|---|
| `agent-browser` | `SKILL.md:7` `<!-- ... upstream: agent-browser CLI ... -->`; `install.sh:20` writes `$GITHUB_ENV`; `SKILL.md:24` self-declares `references/` + `templates/` as cached upstream copies | The `upstream:` token sits in an HTML comment **after** the closing `---`. `lib-vendored.sh`'s awk (`/^---$/ {fm++; if (fm==2) exit}`) exits at the frontmatter close, before reaching it. No LICENSE either. |
| `tailwind-v4-shadcn` | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` carries `author`, `license: MIT`, `repository: github.com/jezweb/claude-skills` | The detector never opens `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. No LICENSE file, no frontmatter marker. |

Both are false negatives of the same shape: **provenance recorded somewhere the detector does not read**. A false negative here is worse than a false positive — it silently licenses the in-place edits the gate exists to prevent (and did: the `tailwind-v4-shadcn` corrections above were made before the vendored status was known).

Two mechanical fixes, neither implemented (out of scope for the trim pass that found them):

1. Scan `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for `author` / `license` / `repository`.
2. Scan the whole file for `upstream:` / `vendored:` / `forked-from:`, not just inside the frontmatter.

Until then, treat a `-` from `check-vendored.sh` as "no marker found in the two places it looks", not as "self-owned".
